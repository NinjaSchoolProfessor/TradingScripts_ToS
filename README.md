# Volumatic VIDYA

A thinkScript implementation of the Volumatic Variable Index Dynamic Average (VIDYA) indicator with volume pressure analysis for ThinkOrSwim (TOS).

## What is Volumatic VIDYA?

The Variable Index Dynamic Average (VIDYA) is a dynamic moving average that adjusts itself based on volatility and momentum rather than relying on a fixed period. It uses the Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) to measure the strength of price movement and modifies its smoothing factor accordingly. When momentum increases, VIDYA becomes more responsive and tracks price changes faster; when momentum fades, it smooths out and filters noise.

Volumatic VIDYA builds on this foundation by integrating volume pressure analysis with VIDYA’s adaptive behavior. This pairing creates a trend-following system that not only reacts to momentum shifts but also factors in buying and selling pressure. Compared to traditional averages like the SMA or EMA, which stay fixed regardless of conditions, Volumatic VIDYA responds dynamically to both momentum and volume, making it more effective in fast-changing or volatile markets.

The indicator provides:

- **Adaptive trend line** that responds faster during strong momentum and slower during consolidation
- **ATR-based cloud** for volatility-adjusted support/resistance zones
- **Delta volume tracking** to measure buy/sell pressure within each trend
- **Buy/Sell signals** with visual bubbles and arrows at trend reversals
- **Summary labels** displaying real-time trend status and volume metrics
- **Customizable alerts** with selectable sounds for trend changes

## Visual Components

### VIDYA Line (Colored Trend Line)

The bright colored line running through price is the Variable Index Dynamic Average itself. This line dynamically adjusts its smoothing based on momentum (CMO) — during strong moves it reacts faster; during consolidation it smooths more.

| Line Color | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **Green** | Bullish trend active — price closed above upper band |
| **Red** | Bearish trend active — price closed below lower band |

The VIDYA line is more responsive than traditional moving averages while filtering out noise, making it ideal for trend identification.

### ATR Cloud (Shaded Volatility Envelope)

The colored cloud surrounding the VIDYA line represents the ATR-based volatility envelope:

| Band | Calculation |
|------|-------------|
| **Upper Band** | VIDYA + (ATR × Multiplier) |
| **Lower Band** | VIDYA - (ATR × Multiplier) |

**What the cloud tells you:**

| Price Action | What Happens | Interpretation |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Price inside cloud | No signal generated | Trend continuation, noise filtered |
| Price closes above upper band | Line turns green, "Buy" signal | Bullish trend flip |
| Price closes below lower band | Line turns red, "Sell" signal | Bearish trend flip |

**Cloud characteristics:**

| Cloud Width | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| Wide cloud | High volatility environment |
| Narrow cloud | Low volatility / consolidation |

The cloud acts as a **noise filter**. Small pullbacks within the bands don't trigger trend changes — only decisive moves through the bands generate signals. When price is riding along the top of a green cloud, that's textbook bullish behavior: VIDYA trending up with price respecting the upper band as dynamic support.

### Buy/Sell Signals

| Signal | Appearance | Trigger |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Buy** | Green arrow + "Buy" bubble below price | Price closed above upper band (trend flipped bullish) |
| **Sell** | Red arrow + "Sell" bubble above price | Price closed below lower band (trend flipped bearish) |

Signals only appear at trend changes, keeping the chart clean and actionable.

## Summary Labels

The indicator displays four summary labels at the top of the chart:

| Label | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **VIDYA: Bullish** | Green | Uptrend active — price closed above upper band |
| **VIDYA: Bearish** | Red | Downtrend active — price closed below lower band |
| **Buy Vol: [value]** | Green | Cumulative volume on up bars (close > open) since last trend change |
| **Sell Vol: [value]** | Red | Cumulative volume on down bars (close < open) since last trend change |
| **Delta: [value]** | Green (positive) / Red (negative) | Net volume pressure (Buy Vol - Sell Vol) since trend started |

### Understanding Delta

**Delta = Buy Volume − Sell Volume** (during the current trend)

Delta resets to zero each time the trend flips.

| Delta | During Uptrend | During Downtrend |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **Large positive** | Confirms strength — buyers supporting the move | Warning — price falling but buyers active |
| **Small positive** | Weak buying — potential exhaustion | Mixed signals |
| **Large negative** | Warning — price rising but sellers active (divergence) | Confirms strength — sellers supporting the move |
| **Small negative** | Mixed signals | Weak selling — potential reversal |

**Example:** Buy Vol: 44.46K, Sell Vol: 40.28K, Delta: 4.18K (green) during a bullish trend confirms the uptrend has participation — buyers accumulated ~4.18K more volume than sellers.

## How It Works

### VIDYA Calculation

1. **Momentum Measurement**: Calculate price change over the momentum period
2. **CMO Calculation**: Separate positive and negative momentum sums to derive the absolute CMO value
3. **Dynamic Alpha**: `alpha = 2 / (length + 1)` adjusted by CMO percentage
4. **VIDYA Value**: `VIDYA = (alpha × |CMO| / 100 × price) + (1 - alpha × |CMO| / 100) × previous VIDYA`
5. **Smoothing**: Final value smoothed with a 15-period SMA

### Trend Detection

| Condition | Trend |
|-----------|-------|
| Price closes above upper band | Bullish |
| Price closes below lower band | Bearish |
| Price between bands | Previous trend continues |

### Volume Pressure (Delta Volume)

The indicator accumulates volume throughout each trend:

- **Up bars** (close > open) add to buy volume
- **Down bars** (close < open) add to sell volume
- **Delta** = Buy Volume - Sell Volume
- Delta resets on each trend change

## Quick Reference Tables

## Recommended Timeframes for Day Trading

| Timeframe | Best For                   | Trade Frequency |
|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| 1m       | Scalping only               | High, many signals with lots of noise |
| 5m       | Best all-around for day trading | Moderate, about 3 to 8 signals per day |
| 15m      | Fewer but higher quality signals | Low, about 1 to 4 signals per day |

### Recommended Settings by Timeframe

| Timeframe | VIDYA Length | VIDYA Momentum | ATR Multiplier | ATR Mult Range | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1m | 12 | 28 | 2.8 | 2.5 to 3.0 | More noise, needs wider bands to filter false signals |
| 5m | 10 | 20 | 2.4 | 2.0 to 2.5 | Good balance for day trading |
| 15m | 10 | 18 | 2.0 | 1.8 to 2.2 | Cleaner price action, can tighten bands |
| 1h | 10 | 16 | 1.7 | 1.5 to 2.0 | Swing trading, price moves are more deliberate |
| 4h | 8 | 14 | 1.6 | 1.4 to 1.8 | Position trading, multi-day holds, cleaner trends |
| 1d | 8 | 14 | 1.5 | 1.3 to 1.7 | Long-term trends, minimal noise, institutional participation |

### Settings by Trading Style

| Style | vidyaLength | vidyaMomentum | atrMult | Notes |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Aggressive | 8 | 16 | 2.0 | More signals, earlier entries |
| Balanced | 10 | 20 | 2.2 | Default, good all-around |
| Conservative | 12 | 25 | 2.8 | Fewer signals, higher quality |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| timeFrame | 5m | Reference for recommended settings (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d) |
| vidyaLength | 10 | Base smoothing period for VIDYA calculation |
| vidyaMomentum | 20 | Lookback period for CMO calculation |
| atrMult | 2.4 | ATR multiplier for upper/lower bands (cloud width) |
| atrLength | 14 | Period for ATR calculation |
| showSummary | yes | Toggle summary labels on/off |
| bullishAlertSound | Ding | Sound for bullish alerts (Ding, Bell, Chimes, Ring, NoSound) |
| bearishAlertSound | Bell | Sound for bearish alerts (Ding, Bell, Chimes, Ring, NoSound) |

### Parameter Tuning

| Adjustment | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Higher vidyaLength** | Smoother line, slower to react |
| **Lower vidyaLength** | More responsive, more noise |
| **Higher vidyaMomentum** | More stable CMO, less adaptive |
| **Lower vidyaMomentum** | Faster adaptation, more sensitive |
| **Higher atrMult** | Wider cloud, fewer signals, higher quality |
| **Lower atrMult** | Tighter cloud, more signals, earlier entries |

**Note:** The `atrMult` is your **primary tuning knob**. Adjust this first, then fine-tune the other parameters if needed.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **VIDYA Line** | Adaptive moving average with trend-based coloring (green/red) |
| **ATR Cloud** | Dynamic upper/lower bands with shaded fill showing volatility envelope |
| **Buy/Sell Arrows** | Visual arrows at trend reversals |
| **Buy/Sell Bubbles** | Labeled bubbles ("Buy"/"Sell") at trend changes only |
| **VIDYA Label** | Shows current trend direction (Bullish/Bearish) |
| **Buy Vol Label** | Cumulative volume on up bars since trend started |
| **Sell Vol Label** | Cumulative volume on down bars since trend started |
| **Delta Label** | Net volume pressure with color indicator |

## Interpretation Guide

### Trend Analysis

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Green VIDYA line | Bullish trend active |
| Red VIDYA line | Bearish trend active |
| Green "Buy" bubble + arrow | New bullish trend starting |
| Red "Sell" bubble + arrow | New bearish trend starting |
| Price riding top of green cloud | Strong bullish momentum, upper band acting as support |
| Price riding bottom of red cloud | Strong bearish momentum, lower band acting as resistance |

### Volume Analysis

| Delta Volume | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| Large positive | Strong buying pressure supporting uptrend |
| Small positive | Weak buying pressure, potential exhaustion |
| Large negative | Strong selling pressure supporting downtrend |
| Small negative | Weak selling pressure, potential reversal |

## VIDYA vs Traditional Moving Averages

| Aspect | SMA/EMA | VIDYA |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Smoothing** | Fixed period | Adaptive to momentum |
| **Responsiveness** | Constant | Faster in trends, slower in ranges |
| **Whipsaws** | More frequent | Reduced due to dynamic adjustment |
| **Calculation** | Simple average | CMO-weighted smoothing |

## Use Cases

- **Trend Following**: Enter on buy/sell signals, ride trends with VIDYA as trailing reference
- **Volume Confirmation**: Validate trends by checking delta volume alignment
- **Momentum Assessment**: CMO-based adaptation reveals underlying momentum strength
- **Risk Management**: Use ATR cloud bands as dynamic stop-loss reference
- **Divergence Detection**: Watch for delta diverging from price direction

## Alert Sounds

Configure different sounds for bullish vs bearish alerts to quickly identify trend direction without looking at the chart:

| Sound Option | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Ding | Short, high-pitched tone (default for bullish) |
| Bell | Classic bell sound (default for bearish) |
| Chimes | Multi-tone chime |
| Ring | Ringing tone |
| NoSound | Silent (visual only) |

## Usage Notes

- Works on any timeframe and instrument
- Most effective in trending markets with clear directional moves
- Delta volume most meaningful on assets with reliable volume data (stocks, futures)
- The cloud width indicates current volatility — wider cloud = more volatile conditions
- Price riding the edge of the cloud confirms trend strength
- Consider combining with RSI or MACD for additional confirmation
- Customize alert sounds to distinguish between bullish and bearish signals
- Not financial advice — always backtest before live trading

### Trend Magic
- Trend Magic (CCI-based) avoids noise and defines the big picture. (pair with Super Trend)
- Trend Magic is a trend-tracking line that uses the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) to determine the market’s directional state and the Average True Range (ATR) to set a dynamic band that acts as support or resistance. It turns bullish (blue) when the CCI value is above zero and bearish (red) when the CCI value is below zero.
```
# Trend Magic Indicator - Uses CCI to determine trend direction and ATR-based trailing stops
# Features:
# - Adaptive trailing stop that follows price based on CCI momentum
# - Blue line when CCI >= 0 (bullish), Red line when CCI < 0 (bearish)
# - Customizable CCI period, ATR multiplier, and ATR period
# - Multiple price source options (Close, Open, High, Low, HL2, HLC3, OHLC4)
# - Toggle between standard ATR (Wilder's) or SMA-based ATR calculation
# - Acts as dynamic support/resistance levels that adjust with volatility

### VWAP
- Standard VWAP with a label that turns green or red depending on the position of price action.
```
# Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Indicator
# Calculates the average price weighted by volume, resetting daily
# Features:
# - Color-coded based on price position relative to VWAP
# - Summary label showing current relationship
#
# VWAP is commonly used by institutional traders as a benchmark for execution quality
# Price above VWAP = Bullish, Price below VWAP = Bearish

### ATR For Futures
 - ATR-based stop loss calculator designed for futures that analyzes true range over a customizable lookback period and provides three stop levels (Tight, Normal, Wide) with empirically accurate percentiles showing your actual risk of being stopped out by normal volatility. Helps swing traders avoid placing stops too tight and getting shaken out of winning trades.

```
declare lower;

# User Inputs
input lookbackPeriod = 60;
#hint lookbackPeriod: Number of bars to analyze for stop calculations. Set based on timeframe:\n1-5min: 100-200 bars\n15-30min: 80-150 bars\n1-4hr: 50-100 bars\nDaily: 30-60 bars\nWeekly: 20-30 bars

# Calculate True Range for all bars
def trueRange = TrueRange(high, close, low);

# Calculate statistics over lookback period
def avgTrueRange = Average(trueRange, lookbackPeriod);
def stdDevTrueRange = StDev(trueRange, lookbackPeriod);
def maxTrueRange = Highest(trueRange, lookbackPeriod);

# Stop distances based on average true range over lookback period
def tightStop = 1.0 * avgTrueRange;
def normalStop = 1.5 * avgTrueRange;
def wideStop = 2.0 * avgTrueRange;

# Calculate ACTUAL empirical percentiles for each stop level
def countBelowTight = Sum(trueRange < tightStop, lookbackPeriod);
def countBelowNormal = Sum(trueRange < normalStop, lookbackPeriod);
def countBelowWide = Sum(trueRange < wideStop, lookbackPeriod);

# Convert to percentages
def actualPercentileTight = Round((countBelowTight / lookbackPeriod) * 100, 1);
def actualPercentileNormal = Round((countBelowNormal / lookbackPeriod) * 100, 1);
def actualPercentileWide = Round((countBelowWide / lookbackPeriod) * 100, 1);

### Opening Range Breakout

## This study is currently a work in progress -- DO NOT USE YET --

- This script identifies and tracks Opening Range Breakouts (ORB) for intraday trading. It measures the high and low during a user-defined opening period, typically the first 15 minutes, then visualizes that range on the chart. The script flags breakouts when price moves and closes above the opening high for a potential bullish setup or below the opening low for a potential bearish setup. When a breakout occurs, it also calculates ATR-based profit targets to help with trade planning. The previous day’s close is displayed for added context, and a real-time status label shows the current ORB direction.

# OPENING RANGE BREAKOUT (ORB) INDICATOR
# This indicator identifies and tracks Opening Range Breakouts for intraday trading.
# 
# WHAT IT DOES:
# - Tracks the high/low range during a user-defined opening period (default: first 15 minutes)
# - Creates visual clouds showing the opening range
# - Detects when price breaks above (bullish) or below (bearish) the opening range
# - Calculates ATR-based profit targets when breakouts occur
# - Displays previous day's close for reference
# - Provides real-time status label showing current ORB direction
#
# BREAKOUT TYPES:
# - "On Close": Breakout confirmed when candle closes outside range (conservative)
# - "On Wick Touch": Breakout triggered when wick touches range (aggressive)
#
# BEST USED ON: 5-minute charts or lower for precise entry timing
